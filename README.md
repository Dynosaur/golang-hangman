`src/main.go` The main file where most game logic is found

`src/array.go` Functions for making dealing with arrays easier. I couldn't find any stdlib functions for stuff like this, but maybe I missed them.

`build.bat` Builds the project into an executable (ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS)

`go.mod` Not really sure what this is, but I can't build or run the project without it

`run.bat` Runs the project without creating an executable in the directory
